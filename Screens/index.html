            <h3>A screen doesn't have to be just a flat rectangle.</h3>
            <p>
            The screen is the modern day canvas, ready to be painted with vibrant pixels.  
            While the <i>content</i> of a screen is obviously important, 
            the <i>context</i> of where it sits is most often overlooked.
            We may glance at a screen at the mall while waiting in line, 
            but chances are low that we remember it afterwards.
            Even if it's a commercial with high production value and millions in budget.
            Maybe even <i>especially</i> if it happens to be that way. And no wonder!
            Our lives are filled with screens and there is no lack of, let's say,
            car commercials with extravagant helicopter shots. It's still just another ad to us.
            <br>
            Of course, this problem is no news to any of us.
            Cutting through the media clutter has been a challenge for content creators ever 
            since cavemen begun painting on walls (presumably).

            <p>
            We often think of a screen as simply a flat rectangular surface, it doesn't have to be that way.
            <p>
            For many years, we've been experimenting with screens as building blocks of larger environments.
            By putting some thought into the the shape of a screen and the context of where it sits,
            you're pretty much guaranteed to get eye-popping results.

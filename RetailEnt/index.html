            <h2>Cutting through the media clutter</h2>

            <p>
            The screen is the modern day canvas, ready to be painted with vibrant pixels.
            Only an artists imagination restricts its contents. 
            However, in this day and age we're so used to these flickering paintings that we barely notice them.
            We may glance at a screen while passing by but chances are low that we remember it afterwards. 
            <br>Of course, this challenge is no news to any of us.
            Cutting through the media clutter has been a challenge for content creators ever since 
            cavemen begun painting on walls (presumably). So what is our approach?
            </p>
            <h2>A screen doesn't have to be a flat rectangle.</h2>
            <p>
            While we often think of a screen as simply a flat, rectangular surface, 
            it doesn't have to be that way. 
            For many years, we've been experimenting with screens as building blocks of larger environments. 
            By putting some thought into the the shape of a screen and the context of where it sits, 
            you're pretty much guaranteed to get eye-popping results.
            <br><br>
            
            While the content of a screen is obviously important, the context of where it sits is most often overlooked. Our background in large scaled live productions for broadcasters and brands has shaped our thought-process differently. Where we're from, screens are used as building blocks of larger environments. They are props in a scenery, used to enhance the story we are about to tell. When we're about to fill a screen, the first question we ask ourselves is actually not what to put in it. Rather: Where is it? Who's there? When? What is the atmosphere like?
